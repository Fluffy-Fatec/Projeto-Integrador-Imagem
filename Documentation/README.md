| 3 | Medium | As a registered user on the platform, I wish to be able to easily update my personal information. Having access to a personalized profile will allow me to edit and maintain my data, ensuring the accuracy of the information stored by the platform. This functionality will be essential for me to keep my profile always updated and accurately reflecting my most recent information. | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | Medium | As a platform user, I desire the ability to filter reviews by geographical region (country, state, city) , allowing me to focus on specific areas of interest. This will streamline the analysis of relevant data for my objective, providing a clearer understanding of patterns and trends in different locations. This functionality will be essential to direct my analysis accurately and extract significant insights related to specific geographical areas. | 1 | 2 |
| 5 | Medium | As a platform user, I aim to have access to graphs and tables presenting sentiment analyses in a clear and understandable manner. This will enable me to gain an overview of the data and identify important trends, facilitating comprehension of the information and assisting in informed decision-making. This functionality will be crucial to improve data interpretation and extract relevant insights efficiently. | 1 | 2 |
| 6 | Medium | As a user, I want to filter data by sentiment category (positive, neutro , negative) and period (date, time). This will enable me to segment and analyze data based on the polarity of sentiments and when they were expressed, facilitating the understanding of sentiment fluctuations over time. | 2 | 2 |
| 7 | Medium | As a user, I want to generate detailed reports that show sentiment trends over time and across different categories, allowing me to better understand how emotions vary in specific areas of interest. These reports should provide graphs and analyses that highlight emotional changes over time, as well as enable comparisons between different sentiment categories. This will help me identify patterns, trends, and valuable insights for making informed decisions.                                                                                                                               | 2 | 3 |
| 8 | Medium | As a user, I want the ability to manually categorize reviews using custom tags. I wish to assign meaningful and relevant tags to each review, allowing for more accurate data organization based on specific analysis criteria. Additionally, I want to be able to edit tags as needed, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in the tagging process.| 2 | 3 |
| 9 | Medium |  As a user, I want access to a detailed record of all report and review sharing activities within the platform. This record should include information such as date, time, involved users, and the shared content. I want to be able to view this log easily and intuitively, allowing me to efficiently track and monitor the distribution of information within the team.                                                                                                                                     | 2 | 3 |

 **Tutorial for Secure Database Restoration**

This tutorial was created to provide clear guidelines on the correct method to perform a database restore, ensuring that previously deleted users are not recovered.

**Requirements:**
- Veracrypt
- Python 3.10
- PyCharm or any other IDE of your choice

**Step 1:**
**Request the Encrypted Project Image:**
Request the encrypted project image.

**Mounting the Image with Veracrypt:**
- Open Veracrypt.
- In the main window of Veracrypt, click on "Mount". The dialog window for entering the password will be displayed.

**Step 2:**
**Access the Project:**
- Open your Python IDE and navigate to the folder where the project is located on the virtual drive M:

**Run the Main Script:**
- Run the file main.py.

**Database Restoration:**
- After executing the script, the database restore will be performed, ensuring that all previously deleted records remain eliminated.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure you have authorized access to the encrypted project image.
- When mounting the image with Veracrypt, use the correct password and select the appropriate PRF algorithm.
- The execution of the main.py script must be performed within the Python IDE in the correct project folder.
- After executing the script, verify that the database restore was successfully completed and that the previously deleted records remain eliminated.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to ensure the secure restoration of the database, preventing previously deleted users from being recovered. Make sure to follow each step carefully to achieve the desired results.
